# Standards & Conventions
---

## Versions
The API endpoint host is [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog). 

All requests to the API endpoint receive the latest version of the API.     

Client applications may request a specific version through the `Accept` header.

    Accept: application/vnd.sundaya.v1.0+yaml

## Date-time Format
Date and time parameters must be expressed in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and must conform to [RFC3359](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) .

    http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/{type}/{period}/{epoch}

e.g. [http:/api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/week/20190210](http:/api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/week/20190210)

The compressed version of ISO 8601 is required, without semi colons and with `T` as the time designator, as shown in examples below.

## Timezones
Timezones are not assumed and must be explicitly specified where API parameters allow for a timestamp to be provided. 

The Timezone can be specified in UTC or local time as shown:

- __UTC__, expressed with a trailing `Z` 

    e.g. [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/minute/20190209T0930Z](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/minute/20190209T0930Z "Z signifies time zone as UTC") == 09:30 UTC

- __Local__ time in Jakarta with +/- offset 

    http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/minute/YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.SSSÂ±HHmm

    e.g. [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/minute/20190209T1630-0700](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/periods/minute/20190209T1630-0700 "-0700 is JKT offset from  UTC") == 09:30 UTC

## Media types
Request `Body` parameters and all response objects are sent and received in JSON. 

Clients should specify and consume `Accept` and `Content-Type` request and response headers to help maintain backward compatibility in their applications. This ensures that an expected response is received, even as new media types or hypermedia schemes are introduced and designated as default.

These media types are currently supported:

    application/vnd.collection+json
    application/json 
    text/html
    text/plain

## Headers
This following example shows a sample HTTP request and response.
```
*** REQUEST ***	
GET /energy/hse/periods/week/20190204/ HTTP/1.1	
Host: api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog
Accept: application/vnd.collection+json	
    
*** RESPONSE ***	
200 OK HTTP/1.1	
Content-Type: application/vnd.collection+json	
Content-Length: xxx	
    
{ "collection" : {...}, ... }
```

## Operations
The API supports basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) using standard HTTP method requests, as summarized in the following table.

Operation | Definition
--- | --- 
`GET` | Retrieve information about the resource.
`POST` | Create, backup, or restore the resource.
`PUT` | Update the resource.
`DELETE` | Delete the resource. 

## Response codes
The API supports a limited set of responses for each API path, based on the following.

Code | Status | Definition
--- | --- | ---
`200` | OK | Data retrieved. 
`201` | Created | Resource created.
`400` | Bad Request | The client specified an invalid argument. 
`401` | Unauthorized | The client does not have sufficient permission. 
`404` | Not Found | The resource was not found.
`500` | Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition.
