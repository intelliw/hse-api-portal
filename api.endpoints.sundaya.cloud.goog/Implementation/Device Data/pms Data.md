# PMS Data
---

A PMS system consists of 1-4 Cabinets with 1 Busbar in each Cabinet.

Each Busbar docks 4-12 **Cases**.

- Case and Pack data are related through a shared **id**.
- Pack data includes the Busbar **dock** number.

A Case contains 14 **Cell Blocks**, 1 **Fet Board**, and 1 **Acqu. Board**. 

PMS data consists of two distinct datasets, _Monitoring_ data and _Transaction/Master_ data, which are joined through a relationship as shown in the model below:

### Monitoring Data

PMS monitoring data is schedule-driven (e.g. every 5 seconds), is append-only, and is time-series data.

The PMS recurring dataset consists of data from:
- 4-48 **Packs**
- 14 **Cells** per Pack
- 2 **Fets** per Pack

The dataset is collected through a recurring schedule and appended to a time-series log. 

Entities in the Monitoring Dataset are linked to Master data through a shared **Pack id** and **Case Id** respectively. 

### Transaction/Master Data 

Unlike PMS monitoring data, master data is event-driven, has inserts and updates, and is infrequently changed.

The PMS master and transaction data includes Cases and Cabinets (Ehub or BBC) assemblies, including a record of changes when components are procured, installed, or swapped.

A **Case** contains:
- 14 **Cell Blocks**
- 1 **Acqu. Board**
- 1 **Fet Board** containing 2 **Fets**

A **Cabinet** contains:
- 1 **EHub**
- 1 **Busbar** with 4-12 **Cases**

A Case links to Pack data through a shared ID. The human readable ID is stored on each Case's **Acqu. Board**.

A PMS can have 1-4 Cabinets. If there are multiple Cabinets the same **PMS id** will be shared and stored on each Cabinet's **EHub**.


### Identifiers

The PMS dataset depends on two identifiers, the rest of the dataset consists entirely of data needed for monitoring and analytics.

**Pack id**

- The **Pack id** _is_ the **Case id** (laser engraved in human-readable form on outside of case).

- Initially (temporarily) the **Pack id** will be populated with the **Acqu Board id** and converted through a lookup to the **Case id** on the server.

- In future the **Case Id** will be directly stored on the **Acqu Board** during pre-shipment configuration. No further data transformation will be required for determining the Pack id during data collection.

**PMS id**

- The **PMS id** is configured for each site during pre-shipment configuration.

- It is stored on each **Ehub** (or BBC); upto 4 EHubs (i.e. Cabinets) can have the same PMS id.

- It allows Packs to be hot-swapped on site without any re-configuration needed.
