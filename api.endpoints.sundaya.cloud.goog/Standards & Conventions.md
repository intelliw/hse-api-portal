# Standards & Conventions
---

## Versions
The API endpoint host is [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog). 

All requests to the API endpoint receive the latest version of the API.     

Client applications may request a specific version through the `Accept` header.

    Accept: application/vnd.sundaya.v1.0+yaml

## Date-time Format
Date and time parameters must be expressed in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and must conform to [RFC3359](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) .

    http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/{type}/{period}/{epoch}

e.g. [http:/api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/week/20190210](http:/api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/week/20190210)

The compressed version of ISO 8601 is required, without semi colons and with `T` as the time designator, as shown in examples below.

## Timezones
Timezones should be explicitly declared where API parameters require a timestamp to be provided. 

The Timezone can be specified in UTC or as local time using one of the options shown below:

- __UTC__, expressed with a trailing `Z` 

    YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.SSSZ

    *20190209T0930Z==09:30 UTC*
    
    e.g. [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/hour/20190209T0930Z](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/hour/20190209T0930Z "Z signifies time zone as UTC") 

- __Local__ time with `+/-` offset 
    
    YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.SSSÂ±HHmm

    *20190209T1630+0700==09:30 UTC, +0700==offset from UTC for Jakarta*

    e.g. [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/hour/20190209T1630+0700](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/hour/20190209T1630+0700 "+0700 is JKT offset from  UTC")

- __Indonesian Western Standard Time (WIB)__ is the default format (UTC+07:00) if there is no trailing `Z` and no +/- offset

    YYYYMMDDTHHmmss.SSS

    *20190209T1630==09:30 UTC, 16:30 WIB (Jakarta)*

    e.g. [http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/hour/20190209T1630](http://api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog/energy/hse/period/hour/20190209T1630 "WIB is the default when there is no 'Z' and no UTC offset provided")
 

## Media types
Request `Body` parameters and all response objects are sent and received in JSON. 

Clients should specify and consume `Accept` and `Content-Type` request and response headers in their applications. This ensures that an expected response is received, even as new media types or hypermedia schemes are introduced and designated as default in future.

These media types are currently supported and specified for each API path:

    application/vnd.collection+json
    application/json 
    text/html
    text/plain
    text/csv

A media type can be requested by sending an `Accept` header:

- If an `Accept` header is *not* specified (or is wildcarded with '*/*') the default `application/vnd.collection+json` media type will be returned. 

- If multiple `Accept` headers are sent the response will select the first matching media type in the list shown above, in the order shown.

- If the request `Accept` headers do not contain a supported type a `415`response (*Unsupported Media Type*) will be returned.


## Headers
This following example shows a sample HTTP request and response.
```
*** REQUEST ***	
GET /energy/hse/period/week/20190204/ HTTP/1.1	
Host: api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog
Accept: application/vnd.collection+json	
api_key: X2zaSyASFGxf4PmOitVS1Dt911PcZ4IQ8PUUMqA
    
*** RESPONSE ***	
200 OK HTTP/1.1	
Content-Type: application/vnd.collection+json	
Content-Length: 10757	
    
[{ "collection": {...}, ... }]
```
 

## Operations
The API supports basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) using standard HTTP method requests, as summarized in the following table.

Operation | Definition
--- | --- 
`GET` | Retrieve information about the resource.
`POST` | Create, backup, or restore the resource.
`PUT` | Update the resource.
`DELETE` | Delete the resource. 

## Response codes
The API supports a limited set of responses for each API path, based on the following.

Code | Status | Definition
--- | --- | ---
`200` | OK | Data retrieved, or queued for processing.
`201` | Created | Resource created.
`400` | Bad Request | The client specified an invalid argument. 
`401` | Unauthorized | The client does not have sufficient permission. 
`404` | Not Found | The resource was not found.
`415` | Unsupported Media Type | The requested Accept header type is not supported.
`500` | Internal Server Error | The server encountered an unexpected condition.

## Security

The API requires a secret Key to authenticate your account. 

Your client application authenticates to the API by providing a secret key in the request header.

### Requesting an API key

You can [request access](mailto:admin@api.sundaya.com) by signing up for an account. 

You can also request an additional key if you need to replace your key in future.

### API key usage

The API key must be provided in all requests as a query parameter, as shown:

Parameter | In | Description
--- | --- | ---
`api_key` | Request header | Each client application has its own unique key. The API gateway pre-authorises requests using this key, and includes it in request logs. 

```
*** REQUEST ***	
GET /energy/hse/period/week/20190204/ HTTP/1.1	
Host: api.endpoints.sundaya.cloud.goog
Accept: application/vnd.collection+json	
api_key: X2zaSyASFGxf4PmOitVS1Dt911PcZ4IQ8PUUMqA
```

`401 Unauthorized` is returned if the API key is not valid or does not have access to the requested path.

```
*** RESPONSE ***	
401 Unauthorized HTTP/1.1	
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 286
```

The developer portal injects an `api_key` **query** parameter for the 'Try this API' interface.

This query parameter is not inspected by the API host and is required only for the portal functionality. 

The `api_key` **header** parameter must also be populated and sent in the request when using the 'Try this API' interface.
